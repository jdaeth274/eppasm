## Working on HIV stuff with Jeff ###########################################

So I need to alter a couple of things for working with Jeff's stuff on the HIV
work.

1. Switch to a more flexible model for diagnosis rate, use a spline/RW
   formulation for this. Even though I think the spline may be already
   implemented in the current framework in CSVAR.

2. Look at switching the death rates to a more flexible model as well. Can use
   splines or RWs again for this. Currently the death rates are stable estimates
   from the literature, input into the matrix from the Spectrum data file.

   I could look to change this around. Have the input of this matrix be modelled
   by a flexible function. Although this will probably significantly slow down
   the run time for the model.


## For installing all of Jeff's github packages I just used install_github, on
## epp, it recognised the need for the dependcies and installed anclik for me!
